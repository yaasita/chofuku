# usage

    chofuku [-100k-only] [-size-only] [-help] /path/to/directory

# description

This program will look for duplicate files.
In most cases, [fdupes](https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes) is faster, so please use that one.
If you want to check only the file size, or only 100kbytes, use this one.
